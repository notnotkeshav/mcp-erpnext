# ERPNext MCP — Roadmap

## Platform Integration (current focus)

The viewer and tooling layer is mature. This phase turns mcp-erpnext from a
single-instance stdio/HTTP server into a multi-tenant, ERP-agnostic platform
reachable through a shared MCP bridge with real identity.

| Item                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Status      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| **MCP bridge wiring**   | Connect to a Deno Deploy relay (local tunnel → cloud → host) so viewers and KPI feeds can be published and shared outside a single host session, not just spawned per-client over stdio.                                       | In progress |
| **ERP-agnostic core**   | Extract the Frappe/ERPNext REST client behind an adapter interface so the same tool catalog and viewers can target other ERP backends. ERPNext becomes the first adapter rather than a hard dependency.                        | Next        |
| **Zitadel auth (OIDC)** | Generic HTTP Bearer/JWT/JWKS validation and RFC 9728 metadata are wired. Validate the Zitadel deployment profile and add per-tool scope enforcement (`erpnext:read` vs `erpnext:write`) before multi-tenant bridge deployment. | In progress |

## Interactive Additions (P0)

Core mutations and drill-down navigation are shipped across all eight viewers.
The generic document surface and attachment list/upload/download workflow ship
in 3.1.0-beta.2. What remains:

| Interaction                | Viewer                         | Tool Called                            | Description                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Inline cell edit**       | doclist-viewer                 | `erpnext_doc_update`                   | Double-click a cell → inline edit → save as PATCH via `erpnext_doc_update({ doctype, name, fields })`. |
| **Quick actions**          | doclist-viewer, invoice-viewer | `erpnext_sales_invoice_create`         | "Create Invoice from SO" and "Mark as Paid" contextual buttons. (Submit and Cancel are already wired.) |
| **Replenish shortcut**     | stock-viewer                   | `erpnext_stock_entry_create`           | "Replenish" button in the stock detail panel → Material Receipt entry.                                 |
| **Funnel → Kanban**        | funnel-viewer                  | `sendMessage`                          | "Open kanban" button per funnel stage → sendMessage to kanban-viewer for that DocType.                 |
| **Conversion badge drill** | funnel-viewer                  | `erpnext_doc_list` (via `sendMessage`) | Click a conversion rate badge → list deals lost or stalled at that transition.                         |

## New Viewers & Infrastructure (P1)

| Item                       | Type                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **HTTP Auth (OAuth/JWT)**  | Infrastructure                       | Wire auth config and test scope-per-tool (`erpnext:read` vs `erpnext:write`) with mcp-erpnext. `@casys/mcp-server` already has the full pipeline (Bearer/JWT/JWKS, Auth0/Google/GitHub presets, RFC 9728). Prerequisite for multi-user deployment. |
| Customer 360 viewer        | New viewer                           | All docs for one customer in one view — orders, invoices, payments, contacts — via `sendMessage`-heavy composition.                                                                                                                                |

| Bank Reconciliation Status | New viewer                           | Match bank transactions to GL entries.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Ideas / Nice-to-have (P2)

- Experimental coordination transport for versioned `erpnext.document.changed`
  facts between independently mounted MCP Apps. Keep ephemeral UI signals
  separate, bind facts to an ERP authority, prevent loops, and let each
  subscriber invalidate then perform its own canonical read. Dependency topics
  stay explicit; do not infer which KPI or aggregate a document mutation
  affects.
- Manufacturing dashboard (Work Order status, machine utilization)
- Multi-currency reconciliation viewer
- Approval queue viewer (pending approvals across doctypes)
- Webhook event log viewer

## Ideas not yet scheduled

Moved out of the old `known-issues.md`, which mixed roadmap ideas with bug
history.

### Setup wizard automation

A fresh ERPNext instance requires master data before being able to create
transactional documents. The tools `erpnext_company_create`,
`erpnext_doc_create`, and `erpnext_setup_check` now exist covering:

1. Create Company (`erpnext_company_create`)
2. Create Price Lists (Standard Selling, Standard Buying) —
   `erpnext_setup_check` flags a missing selling/buying Price List
3. Create Warehouses (or use the ones auto-created by Company) —
   `erpnext_setup_check` flags a company with no Warehouse
4. Create Item Groups if needed — `erpnext_setup_check` flags none existing
5. Create UOMs if non-standard (Nos, Kg, etc. exist by default) —
   `erpnext_setup_check` takes a `required_uoms` list to verify

Still open: none of this runs automatically — an agent has to call
`erpnext_setup_check` and then `erpnext_doc_create` for each gap itself.

### Retry / error context enrichment

When an operation fails (e.g.: MandatoryError), the handler could:

1. Parse the Frappe error
2. Return a structured message with the missing field
3. Suggest the fix (e.g.: "Add selling_price_list field")

### Rate limits / throttling

No rate limiting on the client side. An agent that loops can bombard the ERPNext
API. `FrappeClient` retries reads on 429/5xx, but does not yet perform global
throttling or per-session request budgeting.

### Integration tests

Current tests are all mocked. Integration tests running against a real ERPNext
(Docker) instance would be needed to validate end-to-end workflows. Suggested
Deno pattern:

```typescript
const runIntegration = Deno.env.get("ERPNEXT_INTEGRATION") === "1";
Deno.test({
  name: "integration: sales order create validates ERPNext defaults",
  ignore: !runIntegration,
  fn: async () => {
    /* requires ERPNEXT_URL, ERPNEXT_API_KEY, ERPNEXT_API_SECRET */
  },
});
```
