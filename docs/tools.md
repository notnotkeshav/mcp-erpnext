overview.

## Setup

| Tool                     | DocType | Operations                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `erpnext_user_list`      | User    | List assignable users (enabled System Users)                                  |
| `erpnext_company_list`   | Company | List companies                                                                |
| `erpnext_company_create` | Company | Create (name, abbr, currency, country, domain)                                |
| `erpnext_setup_check`    | —       | Check a company for Price Lists, Warehouse, Item Group, and UOM prerequisites |

`erpnext_setup_check` requires `company` and reports whether a selling and a
buying Price List exist, at least one Warehouse exists for that company, at
least one Item Group exists, and a given set of UOMs exist (`required_uoms`,
defaults to `["Nos", "Kg"]`). Returns `{ ready, missing, checks }` — run it
right after `erpnext_company_create` on a fresh instance to catch gaps before a
transactional document create throws `MandatoryError`.

| `erpnext_doc_assign`    | Assign    | Native assignment (ToDo + notification) to users                         |
| `erpnext_doc_unassign`  | Unassign  | Remove one user's native assignment                                      |
| `erpnext_file_list`     | List      | Read attachments and native File metadata                                |
| `erpnext_file_upload`   | Upload    | Attach base64 data as a native File                                      |
| `erpnext_file_download` | Download  | App-only, authenticated and bounded attachment download                  |
| `erpnext_method_call`   | Call      | Escape hatch for whitelisted Frappe methods (deny-by-default, see below) |

`erpnext_file_list` requires `attached_to_doctype` and `attached_to_name`. Its
optional `limit` is an integer from 1 to 500 and defaults to 50.

`erpnext_method_call` calls `/api/method/{method}` directly for behaviour that
is not a plain document write — custom-app `@frappe.whitelist` methods,
`validate` hooks that reject a direct field update, or GET-only endpoints. It
takes `method` (dotted path), optional `args`, optional `http_method`
(`GET`/`POST`, default `POST`), and optional `invalidate: { doctype, name }` to
drop a document from the read cache after a mutating call. The method must match
an entry in `ERPNEXT_METHOD_ALLOWLIST` — an exact path or a `prefix.*` wildcard
— or the call is rejected before it reaches ERPNext; the variable is unset by
default, so no method is callable until configured. See
[environment-variables.md](./environment-variables.md).

`erpnext_file_upload` requires `file_name`, `content_base64`,
`attached_to_doctype`, and `attached_to_name`; `attached_to_field` is optional.
Files are private by default (`is_private: false` makes them public), accept no
local path or URL, are capped at 10 MiB decoded by default (override with
positive-integer-byte `ERPNEXT_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`), require write permission on
the DocType, and return native `File` metadata.

`erpnext_file_download` is hidden from model tool lists and is callable only by
an MCP App. It accepts the native `File.name` plus the expected parent DocType
and document name, re-fetches that File row without cache, verifies its exact
attachment and private/public path, and downloads it through Frappe's
authenticated handler. It never follows redirects or accepts an arbitrary URL.
The response contains one inline MCP resource for the host's `downloadFile`
channel. Downloads are capped at 10 MiB by default; override the positive byte
limit with `ERPNEXT_MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES`.
