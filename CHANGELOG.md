# Changelog

All notable changes to `@casys/mcp-erpnext` will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `erpnext_setup_check` — checks a company for the master data transactional
  documents need (a selling and a buying Price List, at least one Warehouse, at
  least one Item Group, and a configurable set of UOMs) and reports what's
  missing, with an actionable fix per gap.

### Changed

- The viewer layout decision (`useViewerLayout`) now comes from
  `@casys/mcp-view-components/layout` 0.7.1, which carries the same first-paint
  guarantees as [#29](https://github.com/Casys-AI/mcp-erpnext/pull/29). One edge
  case differs: a host declaring a non-positive container width (`0`, negative,
  `NaN`) no longer forces the narrow layout and falls through to the measured
  width. Every other input resolves to the same layout as before.

## [3.1.0-beta.6] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- **Installing the 3.1 beta follows a channel, not a pinned build.** npm/Node
  uses `@casys/mcp-erpnext@next`; Deno uses
  `jsr:@casys/mcp-erpnext@^3.1.0-beta`. JSR has no dist-tags, hence the range
  there. Exact versions remain in this changelog.
- The generic document viewer now declares its own application version
  (`1.0.0`), like the other seven MCP Apps, instead of echoing the package
  prerelease.

### Fixed

- Opening a document-list detail near the bottom of the frame now brings the
  panel into view. The viewer scrolls only its internal container, never the
  host iframe, waits for the loaded document rather than the loading skeleton,
  and drops the smooth behaviour when the user prefers reduced motion.
- Layout density is decided before the first paint from both container width and
  pointer type, so a narrow touch iframe no longer paints the stacked panel
  layout before settling on mobile.
- A detail whose row leaves the current page, or disappears from the data, now
  closes instead of leaving an unmounted panel with stale content.

## [3.1.0-beta.5] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- **Multi-selection active context across MCP Apps.** Charts, KPIs, funnels,
  document lists, documents, invoice lines, stock rows, attachments, and nested
  levels can contribute up to eight compact business references while keeping
  one bounded local resource available to the host.
- **Allowlisted Frappe method calls.** This beta includes the
  `erpnext_method_call` escape hatch introduced in stable 3.0.3, with exact,
  prefix, or explicit global allowlists and optional cache invalidation after a
  mutating call.

### Changed

- Interactive data now follows one input grammar: click or Space toggles active
  context; double-click or Enter opens detail without changing context. A
  separate compact control keeps detail available to touch and assistive
  technology users. Kanban card titles remain open-only because their card
  surface owns drag gestures.
- Document-list details remain full-width below the selected row. Item, stock,
  supplier, customer, and related-document actions now continue through the
  existing breadcrumb navigation instead of creating disclosures inside
  disclosures.
- KPI and funnel details are explicit breadcrumb actions, while chart and stock
  surfaces retain inline progressive disclosure where the root visualization
  stays visible.
- Viewer tables and detail surfaces now honour the host-provided frame height
  instead of relying on fixed internal heights.

### Fixed

- Active-context selections survive canonical refreshes, repeated visible
  labels, and navigation between homonymous nested levels without retaining
  deleted rows or stale values.
- Chart detail helpers choose their side from the available width and remain
  compact in narrow viewers. Detail controls expose correct disclosure or
  navigation semantics, preserve headings, and meet coarse-pointer target sizes.

## [3.0.3] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- **Allowlisted Frappe method calls.** `erpnext_method_call` provides a
  deny-by-default escape hatch for custom-app `@frappe.whitelist` methods,
  business methods that cannot be represented as direct document updates, and
  GET-only endpoints. Deployments opt in with exact method paths, `prefix.*`, or
  an explicit global `*` through `ERPNEXT_METHOD_ALLOWLIST`; successful mutating
  calls can also invalidate a named document in the read cache. This resolves
  [#21](https://github.com/Casys-AI/mcp-erpnext/issues/21). Many thanks to
  [@notnotkeshav](https://github.com/notnotkeshav) for answering our help-wanted
  request and implementing the feature in
  [#27](https://github.com/Casys-AI/mcp-erpnext/pull/27).

This is an intentionally focused stable maintenance release. The separate 3.1
viewer and attachment work remains on the prerelease channel.

## [3.1.0-beta.4] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- **Inline attachment previews in document and invoice viewers.** PDF, common
  image, text, CSV, Markdown, and JSON files open from the filename without a
  separate large action. Multipage PDFs use the host browser's native page and
  thumbnail navigation; unsupported or oversized formats remain download-only.
- **Optional document context.** Hosts advertising the MCP Apps resource
  modality can add one bounded attachment, plus an optional note, to the active
  context without sending a chat message.

### Changed

- Downloads started from an open preview reuse the already validated bytes
  instead of fetching the attachment twice. Attachment controls now retain
  keyboard focus, expose larger touch targets, and fail closed when the host
  lacks the required capability.
- Sales and generic document navigation now share the same relation registry,
  including customer, supplier, invoice, delivery, payment, item, and stock
  targets where the exact server tools are available.
- Kanban task details now use a wider responsive sheet with related fields
  grouped into compact sections instead of one long single-column form.
- Chart exploration separates navigation from context capture: a single click
  follows the configured drill-down, while a double-click adds the exact mark to
  the active context.

### Fixed

- Document lists fit bounded MCP App frames, render their rows immediately, and
  open record details inline below the selected row instead of in a cramped side
  inspector.
- Analytical charts use a stable intrinsic height, honour an explicit payload
  height, and visibly outline the bar, point, or slice stored in context.
- The active-context menu now uses the themed control surface and modal border,
  avoiding the mismatched dropdown background in dark hosts.

## [3.1.0-beta.3] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- **JSR installations now register and serve the same MCP Apps viewers as the
  npm bundle.** Published JSR modules retain an HTTPS `import.meta.url`; viewer
  resources now preserve that URL and load their packaged HTML from JSR instead
  of treating it as a local filesystem path. This restores `doc-viewer`, Sales
  inspectors, and nested document details for Deno installations.

## [3.1.0-beta.2] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- **Generic `doc-viewer` for ERPNext records.** Twenty-six dedicated `*_get`
  tools and `erpnext_doc_get` now open a responsive document surface with scalar
  fields, long text, progress, system metadata, and ERPNext child tables. Sales
  Order, Sales Invoice, and Quotation keep their specialized invoice viewer.
- **Attachment workflows inside document surfaces.** Users can list and upload
  private-by-default files, choose public visibility explicitly, and download an
  attachment through the MCP Apps host. Uploads are single-flight and only
  report success after the canonical File list has been read again.
- **`erpnext_file_download`**, an app-only read tool. It re-fetches the File
  document, verifies its exact parent and privacy, accepts only a local Frappe
  file path, performs an authenticated no-redirect download, and returns one
  bounded embedded resource. Tool count increases from 125 to 126; viewer count
  increases from seven to eight.
- **Transport-neutral document change events.** A confirmed update, submit,
  cancel, or attachment addition carries its canonical DocType/name and marks
  open navigation snapshots stale without discarding their UI state.

### Changed

- Drill-down record results retain their complete viewer envelope, including the
  server-filtered tool manifest, navigation hints, and refresh request. Child
  actions no longer inherit capabilities from the parent list.
- Mutations invalidate older reads immediately, keep the affected action locked,
  and clear a stale marker only after the corresponding surface has accepted a
  canonical re-read. Hidden parent or child snapshots remain marked stale until
  they are actually refreshed.
- File downloads default to a 10 MiB decoded limit, independently configurable
  with `ERPNEXT_MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES`. Uploads retain their separate
  `ERPNEXT_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` limit.

### Beta compatibility

- No existing tool was removed and no existing input schema was made
  incompatible. The new download tool is hidden from model tool lists and is
  callable only by an MCP App.
- This beta intentionally changes the presentation of generic and dedicated
  record reads from raw JSON to `doc-viewer` in compatible hosts. Hosts without
  MCP Apps continue to receive the normal tool result.
- Synchronization is currently local to one viewer navigation stack. The event
  contract can later be transported by a composition host, but beta 2 does not
  claim automatic synchronization across separate viewers, conversations, or
  external ERPNext edits.

## [3.1.0-beta.1] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- **In-view navigation across all seven MCP Apps.** Compatible hosts open typed
  list, record, and chart targets inside the current viewer, with back and
  breadcrumb navigation that preserves each level's state. Text messaging
  remains available as a host-gated conversational fallback.
- **Active context for charts, KPIs, and funnels.** Compatible hosts receive a
  bounded snapshot through `updateModelContext`. A compact context chip keeps up
  to eight selections, supports individual removal and clear-all, survives
  nested navigation, and resets for a genuinely new viewer root.
- **`erpnext_file_list`** lists a document's attachments with their URL, size,
  privacy, and metadata. Tool count increases from 124 to 125.

### Changed

- Rebuilt all seven viewers with Preact and Tailwind, including responsive wide,
  panel, and mobile layouts, host-aware theme and locale, and complete English
  and French UI catalogs.
- Submit, cancel, and discarding unsaved Kanban edits now use explicit compact
  confirmation sheets.
- Analytical navigation preserves the originating period, filters, clicked
  point, and clicked series. Nested charts retain their chart type, stack, axes,
  currency, unit, and negative-value semantics.

### Fixed

- Viewer actions are gated by host capabilities and the exact tools loaded by
  the server. Category-filtered deployments no longer expose unavailable actions
  or typed navigation targets.
- Mutations refresh through explicit read-only tools instead of risking a replay
  of the write operation.
- Stale or overlapping refresh, navigation, and save responses no longer
  overwrite newer host payloads or edits. Kanban preserves changes entered
  during slow saves and serializes updates.
- Chart and funnel navigation now follows the displayed period and series;
  counts retain their own unit instead of inheriting a chart currency.
- Legacy 3.0 payloads and the published generic-filter schema remain accepted
  while newer payloads carry explicit document and tool identities.

## [3.0.2] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- **Claude Code can load all 124 tools over stdio with MCP 2026-07-28.** The
  bundled framework now uses the official era-aware stdio server, so modern
  `server/discover` and `tools/list` responses carry the required
  `resultType: "complete"`. A client that begins with legacy `initialize` still
  receives the 2025-11-25 response shape. This fixes
  [#22](https://github.com/Casys-AI/mcp-erpnext/issues/22). Many thanks to
  [@cschoa-dotcom](https://github.com/cschoa-dotcom) for the precise report,
  reproduction, and protocol diagnosis.

- Ambiguous-link MRTR now follows the same signed-state and single-use replay
  policy on stdio as on HTTP, including the SDK's compatibility path for legacy
  clients. The framework rejects malformed or replayed retries before an ERPNext
  handler can mutate data.

- The MCP server identity now reports `3.0.2`, matching the package version.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-08-08

### Changed

- use `@casys/mcp-server` `^0.25.0`, which brings four 2026-07-28 conformance
  fixes: `server/discover` over stdio, argument validation on JSON Schema
  2020-12 (draft-07 silently ignored `prefixItems` and the other 2020-12
  keywords), W3C trace-context propagation, and client credentials bound to the
  authorization server that issued them.

  None of that release's breaking changes affect this server: it does not use
  the OAuth client, no tool schema uses the draft-07 tuple form, and no test
  asserts on the method-not-found message.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-07-31

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

- **HTTP transport is stateless in the unreleased code.** Every HTTP request
  must carry `MCP-Protocol-Version: 2026-07-28`, the matching `Mcp-Method`, and
  `params._meta["io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion"]` plus an
  object-valued `clientCapabilities`. A client that omits required protocol
  fields is rejected on every call, including `initialize`. Clients built
  against MCP spec 2025-06-18 send no such field — notably the official
  TypeScript SDK v1 line, whose HTTP transport never emits it. `GET /mcp`
  returns 405; no `Mcp-Session-Id` is issued.

  **stdio clients are unaffected** — the stateless mode gates only the HTTP
  handler. If you connect via `command`/`args`, nothing changes for you.

  Users who need the previous behaviour should stay on the 2.x line. See
  [docs/migration-mcp-spec-2026-07-28.md](docs/migration-mcp-spec-2026-07-28.md).

### Features

- use `@casys/mcp-server` `^0.24` and the complete MCP 2026-07-28 HTTP contract:
  `server/discover`, routing headers, complete result envelopes, and public
  one-hour cache hints for discovery/list/read responses
- offer opt-in signed MRTR link disambiguation where configured with
  `MCP_MRTR_SIGNING_KEY` (exactly 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters); without
  a key or client elicitation, the explicit ambiguity error remains
- do not advertise Tasks: no handler is demonstrated long-running enough and
  framework task storage is process-local; `subscriptions/listen` exists in the
  framework, but ERPNext notifications are not emitted

### Bug Fixes

- **write paths:** resolve supplier and employee names on create handlers —
  `erpnext_purchase_order_create`, `erpnext_leave_application_create` and
  `erpnext_expense_claim_create` required an opaque Frappe ID while their
  `_list` counterparts already accepted human-readable names, so an agent given
  a display name could not succeed at all
- **hr:** `erpnext_employee_get` now resolves a name, honouring the description
  it advertises
- **analytics:** issue independent Frappe queries concurrently in
  `erpnext_sales_funnel`, `erpnext_gross_profit`, `erpnext_profit_loss` and
  `erpnext_product_radar` — one round-trip instead of up to four
- **analytics:** bound `erpnext_product_radar` input to 8 items; the fan-out is
  one Bin query per item

## [2.6.0](https://github.com/Casys-AI/mcp-erpnext/compare/v2.5.0...v2.6.0) (2026-07-23)

### Features

- **HTTP authentication and Docker deployment** — HTTP deployments can now opt
  into static bearer-token authentication (`MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` / `MCP_AUTH_TOKENS`)
  or OAuth JWT validation through a JWKS endpoint, with protected-resource
  metadata for MCP clients. Dockerfile, Compose example, and deployment docs are
  included; existing unauthenticated HTTP and stdio setups remain compatible
  when no auth is configured. Thanks
  [@notnotkeshav](https://github.com/notnotkeshav)
  ([#8](https://github.com/Casys-AI/mcp-erpnext/pull/8)).
- **`erpnext_file_upload`** attaches base64-supplied bytes to any DocType as a
  native Frappe `File`, optionally filling an Attach/Attach Image field. Uploads
  are private by default and have a configurable decoded-size limit. Tool count
  123 → 124. Thanks [@mateotiedra](https://github.com/mateotiedra)
  ([#14](https://github.com/Casys-AI/mcp-erpnext/pull/14)).

### Bug Fixes

- **submit:** Fresh ERPNext instances with null rounded totals no longer fail
  submission; transactional submit tools automatically disable unconfigured
  rounding and return a warning when this fallback is used. Thanks
  [@notnotkeshav](https://github.com/notnotkeshav)
  ([#13](https://github.com/Casys-AI/mcp-erpnext/pull/13)).

### Documentation

- Add a Traditional Chinese README.

## [2.5.0](https://github.com/Casys-AI/mcp-erpnext/compare/v2.4.2...v2.5.0) (2026-07-21)

### Features

- **Human-readable link filters** — tools filtering on a Link field (employee,
  customer, supplier, item, plus dynamic-link fields like Payment Entry's
  `party` or Quotation's `party_name`) now accept a name/email, not just the
  document ID, and resolve it server-side in the same call — no more
  list-then-filter round trip. Ambiguous matches surface the candidate list
  instead of silently guessing, and write paths never fuzzy-match. Thanks
  [@notnotkeshav](https://github.com/notnotkeshav) (#9).
- **Date-range filters** — `date_from`/`date_to` added to 10 list tools that
  lacked them (timesheet, project, task, leave application, payroll entry,
  expense claim, asset, campaign, quotation, supplier quotation). Thanks
  [@notnotkeshav](https://github.com/notnotkeshav) (#7).
- **Pluggable cache layer** — `FrappeClient.list()`/`.get()` are cached through
  a pluggable `Cache` (in-process `MemoryCache` by default, `NoopCache` to
  disable), with automatic invalidation on create/update/delete/submit/cancel
  and optional startup warming. Config: `MCP_CACHE_ENABLED`, `MCP_CACHE_TTL_MS`,
  `MCP_CACHE_WARM_TOOLS`. Thanks
  [@notnotkeshav](https://github.com/notnotkeshav) (#6).

## [2.4.2](https://github.com/Casys-AI/mcp-erpnext/compare/v2.4.1...v2.4.2) (2026-07-21)

### Bug Fixes

- **http:** HTTP mode (`--http`) now binds to `127.0.0.1` by default instead of
  `0.0.0.0`. The server — and every tool, which acts with the server's ERPNext
  API key — is no longer reachable from the whole network unless exposure is
  explicitly opted into via `--hostname=0.0.0.0`, matching MCP security best
  practice. A startup warning is printed when binding to a non-loopback
  interface. Docker deployments must pass `--hostname=0.0.0.0` in the container
  command. Thanks @notnotkeshav for surfacing the exposure gap (#8, #10).

## [2.4.1](https://github.com/Casys-AI/mcp-erpnext/compare/v2.4.0...v2.4.1) (2026-07-16)

### Features

- **`erpnext_doc_unassign`** removes one user's native assignment on any DocType
  via `frappe.desk.form.assign_to.remove` (closes the ToDo, resyncs `_assign`)
  and returns the remaining open assignments. Idempotent on the Frappe side.
  Tool count 122 → 123.
- **kanban-viewer:** per-assignee unassign (×) button in the detail modal, with
  busy/error states.

### Bug Fixes

- **kanban-viewer:** Frappe v16 omits `_assign` from single-doc GET responses —
  the detail modal now rebuilds it from the authoritative assignment result
  (assign and unassign), and treats an explicit empty `_assign` as truly
  unassigned so a just-removed assignee no longer reappears.

## [2.4.0](https://github.com/Casys-AI/mcp-erpnext/compare/v2.3.1...v2.4.0) (2026-07-16)

### Bug Fixes

- **npm/HTTP:** `npx @casys/mcp-erpnext --http` no longer crashes on Node.js
  with `ReferenceError: Deno is not defined`. The npm bundle now consumes
  `@casys/mcp-server`'s own npm build (Node-clean) instead of re-bundling its
  Deno/JSR source, and both packages select their runtime adapter at load time
  instead of a build-time file swap. `build-node.sh` fails fast if the resolved
  `@casys/mcp-server` predates 0.21.1 (first Node-clean release). Thanks
  [@dennypradipta](https://github.com/dennypradipta) for the report and the
  workaround docs ([#4](https://github.com/Casys-AI/mcp-erpnext/pull/4)).

### Features

- **native Frappe assignment across doctypes.** `erpnext_doc_assign` assigns any
  document via `frappe.desk.form.assign_to.add` (permissions, ToDo, realtime
  notifications, and assignment emails preserved), with assignee validation and
  native ToDo IDs in the response. `erpnext_user_list` lists enabled users. The
  kanban detail modal gains an assignee section with a user dropdown
  ([#5](https://github.com/Casys-AI/mcp-erpnext/pull/5)). Based on
  [@mateotiedra](https://github.com/mateotiedra)'s Task-assignment
  implementation ([#3](https://github.com/Casys-AI/mcp-erpnext/pull/3)) — thanks
  Mateo!
- migrate to `@casys/mcp-server` ^0.21 and the `McpApp` API (the deprecated
  `ConcurrentMCPServer` alias is no longer used); audited the deprecated
  Sampling / Logging / Roots capabilities — none used (migration plan §1–2).

## [2.3.1](https://github.com/Casys-AI/mcp-erpnext/compare/v2.3.0...v2.3.1) (2026-05-29)

### Bug Fixes

- **analytics:** `erpnext_stock_chart` no longer fails (HTTP 417) when filtering
  by `item_group`. `Bin` has no `item_group` field, so the group is resolved to
  item codes via `Item` and filtered in memory.

### Documentation

- **readme:** add status badges (JSR, npm, CI, MCP, license) and a Screenshots
  gallery of the 7 interactive viewers.
- add community health files: `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, issue forms, and a pull request template.
- **roadmap:** add the "NEXT — Platform integration" milestone (MCP bridge,
  ERP-agnostic core, Zitadel OIDC auth).

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- **Cross-viewer navigation** — all 7 viewers now support `sendMessage` for
  drill-down into related documents. Click a row, item, data point, or KPI to
  navigate to another viewer.
- **Inline detail panels** — `doclist-viewer`, `invoice-viewer`, and
  `stock-viewer` expand rows to show full document details with action buttons
  (Submit, Cancel, Payments).
- **Chip filters** — `doclist-viewer` auto-detects status/category columns and
  renders clickable filter chips.
- **Interactive charts** — click bar/pie/line/area data points in `chart-viewer`
  to drill into underlying documents via `sendMessage`.
- **KPI drill-down** — click the big number or sparkline in `kpi-viewer` for
  exception lists or trend charts.
- **Funnel redesign** — trapezoid stages with CSS clip-path, gradient fills,
  ambient glow on hover, conversion badges with colored arrows, and
  click-through navigation.
- **structuredContent** — viewer tools return both `content` (JSON text for LLM)
  and `structuredContent` (data object for MCP Apps viewers). Viewers prefer
  `structuredContent` with fallback.
- **ToolAnnotations** — 95 tools annotated with `readOnlyHint`
  (list/get/analytics) and `destructiveHint` (submit/cancel/delete).
- **Shared components** — `ActionButton` (confirm pattern) and `InfoField`
  (key-value display) in `~/shared/` for reuse across viewers.
- **VS Code Copilot config** — `.vscode/mcp.json` example added to README.
- **ERPNext Cloud docs** — documented compatibility with Frappe Cloud /
  erpnext.com instances.
- **`docs/tools.md`** — full tool reference moved out of README for readability.

### Changed

- **@casys/mcp-server upgraded to 0.12.0** — uses `toolErrorMapper`,
  `MCPToolMeta`, `uiMeta()`, `ToolAnnotations` from the framework.
- **`viewer-meta.ts`** — single source of truth for viewer URIs using `uiMeta()`
  from `@casys/mcp-server`. Replaces 91 inline `_meta` objects.
- **Error handling** — moved from try/catch in `buildHandlersMap()` to
  `toolErrorMapper` in server config. Frappe API errors are surfaced with full
  detail.
- **Doclist column cap** — max 6 visible columns (prioritized: name, status,
  customer, grand_total, dates). Extra fields visible in detail panel.
- **Invoice viewer redesign** — two-column party layout, inline dates,
  `FeedbackBanner`, action loading tracked per key, inspired by mcp-einvoice
  pattern.
- **Node build** — uses `npx jsr add` instead of npm for JSR dependency
  resolution (fixes `@casys/mcp-compose` transitive dep).
- **Tests colocated** — all 22 test files moved from `tests/` to sit next to
  their source (Deno convention).
- **README condensed** — tools section replaced with compact category table.

### Fixed

- **VS Code Copilot schema validation (#2)** — `erpnext_doc_list` filters array
  was missing inner `items` schema. Strict JSON Schema validators no longer
  reject the tool.
- **Error messages** — "Tool execution failed" replaced with actual Frappe API
  error messages (e.g. "UOM 'Nos' not found").
- **Chart currency** — `formatCurrency()` now passes `data.currency` instead of
  defaulting to USD.
- **Funnel height clipping** — replaced `height: 100vh` + `overflow: hidden`
  with `minHeight: 100vh`.
- **Race conditions** — doclist row detail fetch guards against stale responses
  when clicking rows quickly.
- **Invoice item expansion** — keyed by line index instead of `item_code` to
  handle duplicate items.
- **Kanban structuredContent** — replaced inline `extractTextContent` with
  shared `extractToolResultText` that supports `structuredContent`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- **Kanban card redesign** — accent-colored top strip (column color), tone-aware
  badges (error/warning/success/info/neutral with semantic colors), vertical
  metric layout with micro-caps labels, and integrated action footer with
  column-colored destination dots.
- **Column-colored move buttons** — each move action button shows a 6px colored
  dot matching the destination column's color for instant visual orientation.

### Changed

- **Column focus mode improvements** — drag-and-drop is now disabled in focus
  mode (narrow viewports ≤920px) since only one column is visible. Cards use
  button-based moves exclusively. Removed unused `onDragOver`/`onDrop` handlers
  from the focus panel.
- **Cursor affordance** — draggable cards in multi-column mode now show
  `cursor: grab` (and `grabbing` on drag).

### Fixed

- **Horizontal scroll eliminated** — added `overflow-x: hidden` on `html, body`
  and the `BoardView` root container, plus `minWidth: 0` on flex children (tabs,
  panel) to prevent content overflow in column focus mode.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- **Canonical read-write kanban MCP App** — `kanban-viewer` is now the single
  kanban surface, backed by `erpnext_kanban_get_board` and
  `erpnext_kanban_move_card`.
- **Kanban adapters for three ERPNext DocTypes** — `Task`, `Opportunity`, and
  `Issue` now share the same normalized board contract, explicit transition
  matrices, optimistic reconciliation, and server-authoritative mutation flow.
- **Shared viewer refresh infrastructure** — server-side `refreshRequest`
  injection plus shared viewer refresh helpers now support safe revalidation for
  long-lived MCP Apps.
- **Refresh-aware passive viewers** — `doclist-viewer`, `stock-viewer`,
  `invoice-viewer`, `chart-viewer`, `kpi-viewer`, and `funnel-viewer` now
  support focus refresh and manual fallback refresh actions.
- **Packaged Node distribution fixes** — the npm/Node bundle now serves the
  packaged MCP server and embedded UI resources correctly in HTTP mode.

### Changed

- **MCP App positioning** — the library is now documented and structured around
  the first production-grade read-write ERPNext MCP App flow, rather than around
  a read-only viewer catalog.
- **Kanban scope** — what started as a `Task` validation path is now extended
  through the same architecture to `Opportunity` and `Issue`.
- **Documentation consolidation** — `README.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`,
  `docs/coverage.md`, and the kanban design/implementation plans now reflect the
  live server surface and current viewer/tool counts.

### Removed

- **Legacy order pipeline surface** — `order-pipeline-viewer` has been removed.
- **Legacy pipeline tools** — `erpnext_order_pipeline` and
  `erpnext_purchase_pipeline` have been removed in favor of the canonical kanban
  path.

### Fixed

- **JSR viewer packaging** — `src/ui/dist` is now included in JSR publish
  artifacts so MCP App viewers are available for JSR consumers.
- **Publish workflow safety** — npm publish now fails on real registry errors
  and only skips when the version is already published.
- **Windows packaged viewer lookup** — resource path resolution now correctly
  handles Windows file URLs for npm bundle viewer assets.
- **Server metadata version** — MCP server version metadata is aligned to
  `0.1.9`.
